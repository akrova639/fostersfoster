			<h3>Our Story</h3>
				<p>We adopted out first French Bulldog, Maui in December of 2019 and instantly feel in love with him.
				They can be high maintenance dogs so we quickly networked with other French dog owners here in Korea.
				During this process we learned that there was a need for foster and permeate homes for these 
				lovable dogs because many people didnt understand what they were getting into when they first adopted.
				My wife and I quickly got involved with a rescue network and have been connecting lovable dogs with lovable
				owners ever since.</p>
			<p>This has all been possible by the real heroes, which is the team over at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/with_frenchbulldog_korea/">With
				FrenchBulldog Korea</a> who both coordinated all of our fosters and adoption as well as allowed me to use their pictures for this project.</p>
