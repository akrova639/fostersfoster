		<p>We fostered Alex the summer of 2020. He was originally turned into the rescue organization because his owner was not in a position she could 
		take care of him. We fostered him for about 3months before he was able to be reuinted with his original owner. They are still very much in love
		to this day</p>

		<p>Eric was rescued from a kill shelter in spring of 2020. We fostered him for about 2 months before finding an 'empty nest' family that was looking for 
		another member. He now happy runs through the country side of the west coast of Korea. We have gotten to see him a couple of time since he was adopted
		and he is always excited to see us. </p>
